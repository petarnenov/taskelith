## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Secret scrubbing
Failures that leave the process SHALL have bearer secrets, GitHub App installation tokens, NKey seeds, NATS JWTs, `.creds` blocks, and PEM private keys redacted, and a child process's environment SHALL keep no secret variable or value.

#### Scenario: Failure with a secret
- **WHEN** a failure's message or details contain a worker secret
- **THEN** the printed failure shows `[redacted]` in its place

#### Scenario: Private key in a failure
- **WHEN** a failure's message contains a PEM private-key block, whole or cut, beside a PEM certificate
- **THEN** the printed failure shows `[redacted]` for the key and keeps the certificate
