Create the proposal document that establishes WHY this change is needed.

Sections:
- **Why**: 1-2 sentences on the problem or opportunity. What problem does this solve? Why now?
- **What Changes**: Bullet list of changes. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**.
- **Capabilities**: Identify which specs will be created or modified:
  - **New Capabilities**: List capabilities being introduced. Each becomes a new `specs/<capability-path>/spec.md`. Name each capability for a durable system behavior (for example, `user-auth`), not the work in this change (for example, `add-login-endpoint`). Choose a cohesive boundary that can own related requirements as the system evolves; avoid broad catch-all capabilities. Use kebab-case for path segments you introduce (e.g., `user-auth` or `identity/user-auth`) and follow the project's existing spec organization.
  - **Modified Capabilities**: List existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing. Only include if spec-level behavior changes (not just implementation details). Each needs a delta spec file. Use the exact existing path under `openspec/specs/`. Leave empty if no requirement changes.
- **Impact**: Affected code, APIs, dependencies, or systems.

IMPORTANT: The Capabilities section is critical. It creates the contract between
proposal and specs phases. Research existing specs before filling this in:
run `openspec list --specs` for the project's capability inventory, then
`openspec show "<spec-id>" --type spec --json --no-scenarios` for any that
look related - that returns a capability's purpose and requirement texts
without pulling whole spec files into context. Append `--store "<id>"` to
both commands only for a registered standalone store, and keep `--type
spec`: a change and a spec sharing a name is otherwise an ambiguous-item
error. `openspec list` without `--specs` lists in-flight changes, not
specs - it never shows what the project already covers. Reuse an existing
capability's exact path instead of introducing a near-duplicate name.
The filtered read is only an overview. Before deciding what is already
covered or what should change, read each relevant spec in full, including
scenarios, with `openspec show "<spec-id>" --type spec` (same `--store` rule).
Each capability listed here will need a corresponding spec file.

Every change must either declare at least one capability (new or
modified) or explicitly opt out of specs: `openspec validate` rejects a
change with zero deltas unless the change's `.openspec.yaml` sets
`skip_specs: true`. Use `skip_specs: true` only when no spec-level
behavior changes (pure refactor, tooling, docs) - specs describe
behavior, so if behavior does not change, no spec should change either.
Do not invent a requirement just to satisfy validation.

Keep it concise (1-2 pages). Focus on the "why" not the "how" -
implementation details belong in design.md.

This is the foundation - specs, design, and tasks all build on this.
